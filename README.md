# Classification of wine quality

Project created to gain some experience and practise with machine learning classfication algorithms.

## About project

Project involves comparison between couple od machine learning algorithms in case of classification whethear wine is good or bad.  
Algorithms/methods used in this project was <b>Logistic Regression</b>, <b>SVM</b>, <b>kNN</b>, <b>Random Forest</b> and <b>XGBoost</b>.  
Scores were calculated using cross validation (with 5 folds).  
Some hiperparameters were optimizing using iterative search, some using random search and some using both.   
Project also includes some exploratory data analysis, with graphs such as histograms, boxplots or heatmap.

## About repository

File <b>Wine quality - classification.ipynb</b> includes whole project. It is pretty long, well I decided to move summary section to the beginning of the notebook.  
Some outputs have been cleared due to their enormus length (outputs like random or iterative search, etc.).  
Repository contains also <b>wine.csv</b> dataset.

For the purposes of this project I used materials from <i>Practical machine learning</i> classes at WNE UW (e.g. wrappers, etc.).
